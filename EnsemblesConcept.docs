Ensembles are methods that combine multiple machine learning models to create
more powerful models. There are many models in the machine learning literature
that belong to this category, but there are two ensemble models that have proven to
be effective on a wide range of datasets for classification and regression, both of
which use decision trees as their building blocks: 
1. Random forests and 
2. Gradient boosted decision trees.
