During training, the SVM learns how important each of the training data points is to
represent the decision boundary between the two classes. Typically only a subset of
the training points matter for defining the decision boundary: the ones that lie on the
border between the classes. These are called support vectors and give the support vec‐
tor machine its name.
To make a prediction for a new point, the distance to each of the support vectors is
measured. A classification decision is made based on the distances to the support vec‐
tor, and the importance of the support vectors that was learned during training
(stored in the dual_coef_ attribute of SVC).
The distance between data points is measured by the

 Gaussian kernel:  krbf(x1 , x2) = exp (ɣǁx1  - x2ǁ^2)

Here, x1  and x2 are data points, ǁ x1  - x2 ǁ denotes Euclidean distance, and ɣ (gamma)
is a parameter that controls the width of the Gaussian kernel
