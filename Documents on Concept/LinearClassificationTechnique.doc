There are two method for linear classification techniques,

*Linear Logistic Regression:*
- Logistic regression is like drawing a straight line to separate different classes.
- It predicts the probability of belonging to a particular class.
- Works well for binary classification problems.

*Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM):*
- SVM is like finding the best-fitting line that maximally separates different classes.
- It aims to maximize the margin between classes.
- Effective for binary and multiclass classification.

*Key Difference:*
- Logistic regression focuses on probabilities and the likelihood of belonging to a class.
- SVM focuses on finding the best line that maximally separates classes, aiming for a clear boundary.

In essence, logistic regression is about probabilities, while SVM is about maximizing the separation between classes with a clear margin. Does that clarify the distinction, or do you have more questions on this?



The term "Support Vector Machine" (SVM) originates from the unique role played by certain data points in the classification process. Here's why it's called a Support Vector Machine:

1. *Support Vectors:*
   - In SVM, the decision boundary (hyperplane) is determined by a subset of data points called "support vectors."
   - These support vectors are the data points closest to the decision boundary and play a crucial role in defining the optimal separation between classes.

2. *Maximizing Margin:*
   - SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
   - The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vector.

3. *Critical Support:*
   - Support vectors are critical because they influence the position, orientation, and robustness of the decision boundary.
   - Changes in other data points may not impact the decision boundary, but a shift in a support vector could alter it.

In essence, the name "Support Vector Machine" reflects the emphasis on these critical support vectors that guide the construction of the optimal decision boundary. The method leverages these vectors to achieve a clear and well-defined separation between different classes.
